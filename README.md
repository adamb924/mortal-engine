# mortal-engine
Mortal Engine is a morphological engine, which allows you to create morphological models of languages, so that you can test the model, use it for spellchecking, transduce between different writing systems, etc. It is available both as a library and as a command line utility. All of the inputs to the program are in XML, and an effort has been made to make the format intuitive.

Further documentation is available in the wiki. (https://github.com/adamb924/mortal-engine/wiki)
